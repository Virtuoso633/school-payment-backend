# PG Secret Key (Needed for signing JWTs for the payment API requests)
# IMPORTANT: The assessment docs mention "PG Secret Key" for signing.
# We need to clarify if this is DIFFERENT from PAYMENT_API_KEY or PAYMENT_PG_KEY.
# Assuming for now it might be the same as PAYMENT_PG_KEY or requires clarification.
# Let's add a placeholder. If the payment API requires a separate secret for signing *its* JWTs, use that here.
# Based on the Payment API Docs: "sign it using the PG Secret Key" - this likely refers to a key provided by Edviron *specifically* for signing *your* requests TO them.
# Let's assume it's NOT the `PAYMENT_API_KEY` (which is used for Bearer auth). Let's add a placeholder.
# You might need to ask for clarification or look for it in Edviron's documentation if available.
# UPDATE: Re-reading "JWT Signing (sign)" in the Payment API docs: It says "sign it using the PG Secret Key".
# It DOES NOT explicitly provide this key. The `PAYMENT_API_KEY` is used in the `Authorization: Bearer` header.
# The `PAYMENT_PG_KEY` (`edvtest01`) seems like an identifier, not a secret.
# --> We will need a value for PG_SECRET_KEY to proceed with the payment JWT signing later.
# Let's add a placeholder and note this dependency. Ask the assessor if needed.
PAYMENT_PG_SECRET_KEY=PROVIDED IN DOC SAME AS PAYMENT_PG_KEY # Placeholder - NEED TO FIND/GET THIS VALUE!
